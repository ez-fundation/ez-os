# EZ-OS Companion: The "Nano Banana" Character Design Bible

> **Project**: EZ-OS  
> **Subject**: Procedural Companion (Mascot)  
> **Design Philosophy**: "Retro-Futuristic Tamagotchi meets Industrial Design"

## 🎨 Visual Concept

The companion is a physical manifestation of digital memory. It is not just a character; it is a **container of history**.

### **Core Aesthetics**
- **Form Factor**: Dense, tactile, handheld. Think high-quality industrial plastic from the 90s (Braun, Nintendo, Sony).
- **Proportions**: "Chibi" mechanical. Big head/body block, tiny stabilizing limbs.
- **Texture**: Matte finish for the chassis, high-gloss for the screen faceplate.
- **Vibe**: Helpful, neutral, observant to compliant.

## 📐 3D Printing Specification

This design is optimized for FDM printing with minimal supports.

### **Geometry Anatomy**
1.  **Chassis (Body)**:
    -   30mm³ Rounded Cube (Chamfered Box).
    -   Corner Radius: 2.5mm (Soft but technical).
    -   Surface: Matte texture.

2.  **Faceplate (Screen)**:
    -   Recessed 0.5mm into the front face.
    -   Material: Glossy Black/Green insert.
    -   Display: Pixel grid (simulated or real).

3.  **Antenna (Signal)**:
    -   Position: Top Right.
    -   Structure: Rigid stalks, spherical tip.
    -   Color: RAL 3020 (Traffic Red).

4.  **Limbs (Mobility)**:
    -   Legs: Cylindrical stubs (stability).
    -   Arms: None (canonical) or floating spheres (evolutionary).

## 🤖 Procedural Evolution (The "Ghost in the Shell")

The physical print is the "Shell". The "Ghost" (personality) evolves procedurally.

### **Evolutionary Stages**

| Stage | Visual Cues | Unlock Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stage 1: Base** | Clean grey chassis, neutral face. | Start |
| **Stage 2: Engaged** | Color shift (Green/Blue tint), expressive eyes. | 10 Sessions |
| **Stage 3: Veteran** | Weathered texture, "Hacker" accessories (hat/glasses). | 100 Hours |

## 🖌️ Render Prompt (Midjourney / DALL-E)

Use this prompt to visualize the final design:

> "A high-fidelity 3D render of a retro-futuristic desktop robot companion, designed in a charming low-poly voxel hybrid style. The character is a small, cube-shaped robot (approx 30mm) with rounded chamfered edges, made of matte Light Grey (RAL 7035) plastic. It has a glossy Dark Moss Green (RAL 6005) rectangular screen faceplate recessed into the front, displaying a glowing Luminous Yellow (RAL 1026) pixel-art face with a friendly neutral expression. On the top right of its head, there is a small rigid antenna with a Traffic Red (RAL 3020) spherical tip. It stands on two short, cylindrical stubby legs. The lighting is soft studio lighting with rim light to highlight the matte texture of the plastic and the glossiness of the screen. The background is a clean, minimal engineering workspace with a blurred blueprint depth of field. 8k resolution, highly detailed materials, macro photography style, isometric view."
